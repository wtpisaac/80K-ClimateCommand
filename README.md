# Climate Command
This game was designed and developed as part of my CMPM 80K course at UCSC.
It is designed to be a clone of Missile Command with themes of climate change,
and uses the Godot Engine for 2D gameplay.

Art and assets created by Cody Cochlin, all programming work done by me (Isaac
Trimble-Pederson)

The game is made available under the terms of the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
